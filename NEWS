Changes in version 0.2.7 2017-07-26
     + Forced the ylim for the plot from qMS to be c(0, 100) and added a horizontal line at y = 0.
     + Fixed a problem in plotNMRspec which prevented spectra with a single peak (e.g. t-butyl) from having the peak area displayed.

Changes in version 0.2.2 2016-01-26
     + Added function emSpectrum which draws a nice electromagnetic spectrum for teaching purposes.
     + Added function plotCIEchrom which plots the 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram with various annotations.  This was previously in package photoSpec, whose development is stalled.  Helper functions prepCIEgradient, getWhiteValues and getGamutValues as well as data set CIExyz were brought over as well.
     + Improved documentation for plotNMRspectra.
     + Changed some technical details of how data set CIExyz becomes available.

Changes in version 0.1.19 2015-07-16
     + Revised imports for new CRAN namespace policies.

Changes in version 0.1.6 2015-05-08
     + Code tweaking to speed up examples for CRAN checks

Changes in version 0.1.5 2015-05-07
